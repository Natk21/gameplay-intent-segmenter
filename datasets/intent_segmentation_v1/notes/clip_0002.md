# Clip 0002 Notes

## Phase Justifications

### 0.0–5.6s — Explore
- Player spawns/re-enters space and begins scanning.
- Irregular camera motion with left–right sweeps.
- Low-intensity, non-committal movement.
- Direction changes without stable target.
- Explore indicators: scanning, no directional persistence, low-intensity wandering.

### 5.6–9.2s — Pursue
- Player locks onto a corridor/enemy lane.
- Sustained forward motion with minor steering.
- Camera stabilizes and centers down-lane.
- No exploratory reversals.
- Directional persistence ≈ 3.6s (clears 1.2s threshold).

### 9.2–11.0s — Execute
- Firing window begins.
- Sharp camera micro-jolts and recoil.
- Burst of rapid input.
- Irreversible combat action resolving the short-term goal.

### 11.0–14.3s — Outcome
- Kill feed/hit confirmation appears.
- Motion drops sharply; camera steadies.
- Player does not immediately chain another action.
- Outcome duration ≈ 3.3s (clears 0.8s threshold).

### 14.3–18.9s — Explore
- Player re-orients; irregular camera sweeps resume.
- Direction changes without a stable target.
- New decision branch opens here.

### 18.9–22.1s — Pursue
- Player commits to a second lane/enemy direction.
- Sustained forward motion; reduced scanning.
- Camera becomes supportive again.
- Directional persistence ≈ 3.2s (valid Pursue).

### 22.1–23.6s — Execute
- Second firing burst.
- Localized high-intensity motion.
- Precise aim corrections.
- Irreversible action.

### 23.6–26.43s — Outcome
- Kill confirmation appears.
- Player decelerates; camera stabilizes.
- No immediate new commitment before clip ends.

## Borderline / Ambiguous Regions

### A) 5.0–6.0s (Explore → Pursue boundary)
- Forward motion begins but camera still oscillates.
- Applied rule: earlier-phase bias + persistence requirement.
- Pursue starts at 5.6s once direction stabilizes and persistence ≥ 1.2s.

### B) 10.8–11.4s (Execute → Outcome boundary)
- Short recoil/reload-like micro-motion.
- Applied rule: collapse sub-0.5s dips into neighboring Execute.
- Execute held until firing fully ceases and motion drops.

### C) 14.0–15.0s (Outcome → Explore boundary)
- Motion drops first, then scanning resumes.
- Applied rule: Outcome held until a new decision branch opens.

### D) 21.8–22.3s (Pursue → Execute boundary)
- Tiny aim jitter before firing.
- Applied rule: Execute gated on irreversibility (firing), not aim lock.

## Likely Algorithm Failure Modes

### 1) Premature Execute at first enemy contact
- Enemy becomes visible around ~7s; naive salience may fire Execute early.
- Fix: require firing/interaction/jump/dodge for Execute.

### 2) Explore misfire during Pursue windows
- Minor camera jitter during 6–9s and 19–22s.
- Fix: use directional vector persistence instead of raw camera entropy.

### 3) Outcome collapsing too early
- Motion drops immediately after kills.
- Fix: force Outcome ≥ 0.8s after last Execute spike.

### 4) Micro-flicker around Execute windows
- Short recoil or reload gaps.
- Fix: merge Execute windows separated by < 0.7s.

## Calibration Rules Derived From This Clip

### Rule A — Execute Gate
- Do not label Execute unless:
  - firing, or
  - interaction animation, or
  - jump/dodge/timed maneuver
  is detected.

### Rule B — Pursue Qualification
- Label Pursue when all hold:
  - directional persistence ≥ 1.2s
  - camera entropy flat or decreasing
  - no large scanning reversals (>45°)

### Rule C — Outcome Hold
- Once Execute ends:
  - force Outcome ≥ 0.8s
  - unless a new Execute begins immediately

### Rule D — Explore Suppression
- Explore cannot occur if:
  - directional variance < θ, and
  - forward velocity > v_min
  for ≥ 1.2s

## Summary
- Enemy visibility ≠ Execute.
- Motion drop ≠ Explore.
- Directional persistence beats camera jitter.
- Outcome must be explicitly gated.
- Execute must be irreversibility-gated.
