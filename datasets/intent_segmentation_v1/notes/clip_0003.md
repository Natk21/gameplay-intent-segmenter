# Clip 0003 Notes

## Phase Justifications

### 0.0–4.2s — Explore
- Player spawns and begins slide-hopping to build momentum.
- Camera sweeps left/right to scan doorways.
- Irregular movement with no specific target engagement.
- Mental mode: "What's the current map flow?"

### 4.2–5.8s — Pursue
- Player locks gaze toward the archway leading to the courtyard.
- Camera stabilizes as the player moves in a consistent vector.
- Directional persistence ≈ 1.6s.

### 5.8–8.5s — Execute
- Engagement with Guest_2 begins.
- Sharp motion spikes from sniper recoil and jumping.
- High-intensity combat maneuvers.

### 8.5–9.8s — Outcome
- Kill confirmation on screen (+100 points).
- Motion drops; player stabilizes to check for immediate trades.

### 9.8–11.2s — Execute
- Reactive case: a target appears in the side corridor.
- Immediate flick-shot with no planning window.
- Transition: Outcome → Execute (reflexive).

### 11.2–17.5s — Explore
- Player returns to information gathering.
- Fast rotations through the stone corridors.
- Camera decoupled from movement vector to check corners.

### 17.5–20.1s — Pursue
- Player identifies a target near the Hardpoint objective.
- Intent is unambiguous: "I am going to clear that point."

### 20.1–26.3s — Execute
- Multiple quick-scope attempts and successful hits.
- Rapid input bursts and aggressive local movement.

### 26.3–30.8s — Outcome
- Area cleared; player slows down, reloads, watches capture progress.
- Duration ≈ 4.5s (result processing).

### 30.8–45.1s — Explore
- Exiting the point to find a new engagement.
- Searching the open courtyard; high camera entropy with 180-degree checks.

### 45.1–47.5s — Execute
- Long-range engagement.
- Firing sequence starts immediately upon visual contact.

### 47.5–52.3s — Explore
- Shot lands, then immediate wide scan for next target.

### 52.3–57.8s — Execute
- Intense firefight with jumping and dodging.
- High-frequency input pulses; irreversible combat actions.

### 57.8–63.4s — Outcome
- Post-fight slowdown and stabilization.

### 63.4–75.0s — Explore
- Searching for the next engagement.

### 75.0–77.2s — Pursue
- Aggressive push setup into the bridge area.

### 77.2–82.0s — Execute
- Rapid succession of shots fired.
- Decisive action resolving bridge control.

### 82.0–85.5s — Outcome
- Immediate post-engagement stabilization.

### 85.5–95.2s — Explore
- Reset and search for final engagement.

### 95.2–98.1s — Pursue
- Commitment to the final lane; scanning ceases.

### 98.1–100.0s — Execute
- Final firing sequence until clip end.

## Borderline / Ambiguous Regions

### A) 9.5–10.0s (Outcome → Execute boundary)
- Transition is nearly instantaneous from resolution to reflex shot.
- Applied rule: chaining; Outcome cut short because new Execute starts immediately.

### B) 47.5–52.3s (Outcome vs Explore)
- Shot lands then immediate wide scan.
- Applied rule: Outcome ends early because a new decision branch opens.

## Likely Algorithm Failure Modes

### 1) Over-labeling Explore during combat
- Flicking during firing can look like scanning.
- Fix: gate Execute on weapon state/firing events overriding entropy.

### 2) Premature Pursue during slide-hopping
- High velocity in a straight line can mimic Pursue.
- Fix: require reduced scanning (low camera variance) ≥ 1.2s.

### 3) Missing reactive Executes
- Reflex shots often skip Pursue.
- Fix: allow Explore → Execute if a motion spike occurs within 0.5s of enemy appearance.

## Calibration Rules From This Clip

### Rule G — Sniper Gate
- Hold Execute through reload if local high-intensity movement continues.

### Rule H — Scanning Suppression
- If camera moves > 60° in < 0.3s, it is Explore regardless of velocity.

## Summary
- High-density training sample for chained Executes and momentum-based Explore.
- Outcome is volatile; enforce duration to avoid flicker.
