# Clip 0001 Notes

## Phase Justifications

### 0.0–4.8s — Pursue
- Player is already locked onto visible enemies at clip start.
- Sustained forward-facing movement and aim stabilization.
- Camera motion is supportive, not exploratory.
- Unambiguous short-term goal: engage the enemy ahead.
- No Explore at the start; the clip begins mid-commitment.

### 4.8–6.4s — Execute
- Weapon firing window (sniper discharge).
- Sharp camera micro-jolts and recoil.
- Irreversible action resolving the immediate goal.
- Corresponds to the kill feed timing.

### 6.4–9.8s — Outcome
- Kill feed appears ("You → aliketal").
- Motion drops and camera steadies.
- Player does not immediately re-engage.
- Pure result-processing window.

### 9.8–18.7s — Explore
- Wandering and scanning behavior.
- Irregular camera motion.
- Direction changes with no target lock.
- No clear short-term goal commitment.
- Strong Explore indicators: scanning, non-persistent direction, low motion intensity.

### 18.7–23.1s — Pursue
- Player locks onto a new corridor and advances.
- Directional persistence ≥ 4s.
- Camera stabilizes and centers lanes.
- Unambiguous short-term goal: reach or challenge the lane.

### 23.1–25.4s — Execute
- Second firing burst.
- Localized high-intensity motion.
- Precise aim corrections.
- Irreversible attack window.

### 25.4–28.6s — Outcome
- Kill feed updates again.
- Movement decelerates.
- Camera stabilizes.
- Player pauses before making next decision.

### 28.6–35.31s — Explore
- Re-orientation and scanning.
- Direction changes without payoff.
- No sustained commitment.
- Clear opening of a new decision branch.

## Ambiguous / Borderline Regions

### A) 0.0–1.0s (Clip start)
- Risk: mislabeled as Execute by naive logic.
- Reason: enemy already on screen, player already aiming.
- Rule: no irreversible action yet; still Pursue.

### B) 9.5–10.5s (Outcome → Explore boundary)
- Motion drops, then scanning resumes.
- Applied rule: earlier-phase bias + minimum duration thresholds.
- Outcome held until scanning is clearly established.

### C) 17.8–19.0s (Second engagement lead-up)
- Small camera oscillations while moving forward.
- Test: "If paused here, is the player's goal unambiguous?"
- Result: yes; moving down a specific lane → Pursue.

## Likely Algorithm Failure Modes

### Error 1: Premature Execute at clip start
- Cause: enemy visible, weapon already aimed, high salience.
- Gold: no irreversible action yet; still Pursue.
- Fix: gate Execute on irreversibility, not enemy presence.

### Error 2: Outcome collapsing into Explore too early
- Cause: motion drops after kill; camera steadies.
- Gold: still in result-processing; no new decision branch.
- Fix: enforce Outcome hold window.

### Error 3: Explore misdetected during Pursue (18–23s)
- Cause: minor aim oscillations and micro-jitter.
- Gold: directional persistence and stable forward goal.
- Fix: use vector-direction persistence over raw camera entropy.

### Error 4: Micro-phase flicker around Execute windows
- Cause: single-frame action bursts or short recoil gaps.
- Fix: absorb sub-0.5s dips into neighboring Execute.

## Calibration Rules Derived From This Clip

### Rule 1 — Execute Gate
- Do not label Execute unless:
  - a firing event, or
  - an interaction animation, or
  - a jump/dodge/timed maneuver
  is detected.

### Rule 2 — Pursue Qualification
- Label Pursue when all hold:
  - directional persistence ≥ 1.2s
  - camera entropy decreasing or flat
  - no scanning reversals > 45°

### Rule 3 — Outcome Hold
- Once Execute ends:
  - force Outcome ≥ 0.8s
  - unless a new Execute begins immediately

### Rule 4 — Explore Suppression
- Explore cannot occur if:
  - directional vector variance < θ, and
  - forward velocity > v_min
  for ≥ 1.2s
